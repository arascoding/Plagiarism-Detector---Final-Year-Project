# Plagiarism-Detector---Final-Year-Project
Academic communities across the globe are faced with increasing occurrences of plagiarism. This worldwide problem has motivated the need for a robust, efficient and fast detection system, that would otherwise be difficult to achieve manually. This thesis looks at the
construction and implementation of a copy-detection tool that is designed to support academics
in schools and universities in the detection of plagiarism for a pair of programs written in the
programming language Java. Before the copy-detection tool can be designed, we analyse
existing systems and algorithms in place that deal with the issue of plagiarism. Based on these
approaches and the agile software development methodology we identify all the requirement
necessary for a successful detection tool and the series of steps needed to implement a detection
tool that has been well directed and advised.
